## Brief Overview in the life of a local chapter

**Community Coordination**

* The team start the year by reaching out to different organisations, attending events to promote volunteering opportunities at CYF and social media campaigns. The idea will be to renew the leadership teams and find new core members to lead the program locally. A priority will be given to Education team.
* The team will then start finding new students by contacting a number of organisations working with refugees and disadvantaged groups with the goal of getting them to promote our program to their clients. The team will also start social media campaigns (particularly Facebook) to get new applicants.
* The team will organise volunteering and drop-in sessions to welcome people interested in joining the program. In the drop-in sessions the applicants start working together to support each other in their process.

**Tech Education**

* The team and supporting members will start by reviewing the steps submitted by the students and start getting to know applicants during the application process.
* The team will then coordinates the onboarding of trainers and TA to run the classes. They organise training sessions to support new trainers that will be leading sessions and for the groups to get to know each other.
* The team collects the feedback from classes and weekly homework review and discusses weekly the performance of the students.
* The team members work together with PD team to exchange feedback on students and find ways to increase support of those that are underperforming.

**Professional Development**

* The team is in charge of ensuring that applicants are eligible to apply to the program based on their personal situation. They decide with the education team who gets accepted

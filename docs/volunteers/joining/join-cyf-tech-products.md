# Join CYF Tech Products

To join the CYF Products team, you must have signed the [volunteer form](https://forms.codeyourfuture.io/) and done the Welcome Event (for external volunteers).

First of all, **thank you for your interest** in joining this team. We depend on volunteers like you, to keep our teams running and to be able to improve our products.

The steps for this your application are:

1. Apply on our [Product for](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10JLyTyfhriO-uuQCEjmMRzcwMz35P0f5i4tjKL2Ww70/edit)m for the role you are interested in (see all [roles here](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/volunteers/teams-1/cyf-products-final-projects/roles))
2. Once you receive our exercise OR Codility test, please do it within the next 7 days. _You must pass your test with at least 75%._
3.  Developers that pass step 2 must build a full stack product within 2 weeks.&#x20;

    _Briefing:_\
    _- It can be anything you want_\
    _- You can use any stack you prefer (FYI, some of our systems use MongoDB as DB, instead of SQL)_\
    _- It should have end-to-end (e2e) simple automated testing_\
    _- it must be deployed_\
    _- It is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), so doesnâ€™t have to be perfect, just something that shows your interest and your abilities_
4. You will then have an interview with the following agenda:\
   \- Introductions\
   \- Demo of your exercise (non-technical roles) and full stack product (developers)\
   \- Technical questions \
   \- Competency-base questions\
   \- Wrap-up
5. You will receive the feedback of your interview

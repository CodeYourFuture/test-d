# Leaving or Stepping Back

It's normal for you not to be able to commit to volunteering at some point!&#x20;

If you plan to take a short-term or long-term break from volunteering, you should tell your regional volunteer team so they can plan accordingly.&#x20;

If you are part of any CYF Google Groups, please remove yourself. You can always be readded upon return. We need to do this mainly for data/privacy and account number restrictions.&#x20;

If you are stepping back long-term, please get in touch with a CYF staff member so we can deactivate your account. Don't worry, we can reactivate your account easily if you return!&#x20;

Also, don't forget to sign up for our email newsletter (scroll to the bottom of [our website](https://codeyourfuture.io/) to enter your email) to get little monthly updates on what's happening at CodeYourFure :relaxed:

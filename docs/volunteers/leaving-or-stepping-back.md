# Leaving or stepping back

It's normal for you not to be able to commit to volunteering at some point! We ask that if you plan to take a short-term or long-term step back from volunteering, you tell your regional programme manager so they can deactivate your accounts. We need to do this mainly for data/privacy and Slack/Google account number restrictions. Don't worry, we can reactivate your accounts easily if you come back! Also, don't forget to sign up for our email newsletter (scroll to the bottom of [our website](https://codeyourfuture.io/) to enter your email) to get little monthly updates on what's happening at CodeYourFure :relaxed:

# Technical Assistant

The assistant role is to guide trainees in small groups or individually through the lesson.

You will be a mentor, so rather than giving answers, you are expected to ask questions.

You motivate trainees and encourage them to ask good questions. You support trainees that have done their prep work, as expected. And if others haven't, you incentivise them to do that first.

You will be working more closely with our trainees than anyone else in the organisation and so you are a crucial part of the relationship.&#x20;

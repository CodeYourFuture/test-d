# Lead Trainer

The Lead Trainer handles the class pace and the involvement of our other volunteers. It is an important and impactful role where you can have a huge impact on our traineeâ€™s education

We use the flipped classroom method: you and other volunteers won't be teachers, but facilitators. Read more about how our curriculum works on this [page](https://sdc.codeyourfuture.io/how-our-curriculum-works/).

People will look to you as a figure of authority and leadership. You will help create and incentivise the community to be responsible for their own learning and the group.

## How to do the Coursework review

* [ ] Get familiar with the process of reviewing coursework via [this video](https://app.wowto.ai/link/MWJD8ZwiKpb\&locale=english\&showplaybackspeed=true\&showsubtitle=true)
* [ ] Use this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lKrPAQkW0Mzn42d4nJxuOP01cTHjv7k3LlciH3XCoAY/edit#gid=0) to assign yourself to coursework and grade it as pass/no pass.
* [ ] When reviewing trainees' coursework tickets, follow the curriculum
* [ ] Give trainees efficient and kind feedback with clear examples so they can become better professionals. We suggest using the SBI Model (Situation, Behaviour, Impact)

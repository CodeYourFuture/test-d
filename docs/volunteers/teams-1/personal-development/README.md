# Professional Development

### Why Professional Development?

At Code Your Future, we want to help people change their lives. We do this by teaching them skills to get good jobs in the tech industry.

We work with people who find it very hard to get jobs. And we know that just learning about tech is not enough to help someone get a job.

### What do we do?

We made a plan to help people get better at work skills. We call this our Professional Development (PD) curriculum. The volunteers use this curriculum to help our students learn better and make it easier for them to get jobs.

### How do we do that?

We need our trainees to understand that within tech teams people with different skill sets will be working together. We all have skills that can help a team. And we all have to learn some of them to be a better professional.

Our competencies are based on these soft skills:

* Basic professional skills
* Confidence
* Communication
* Time/Project management
* Teamwork
* Problem-Solving
* Employability&#x20;

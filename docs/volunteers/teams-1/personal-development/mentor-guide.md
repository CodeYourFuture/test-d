# PD Coach Guide

**Before you start**

There are a couple of things that you should do before you start:

* Read the [Code of Conduct](https://codeyourfuture.io/about/code-of-conduct/) carefully and ensure that you understand and agree with it
* Read the [Safeguarding presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10DA\_Z3mglS4XHPNygTNmJP1s9lXT6y6joM-94-d9pC8/edit#slide=id.g1398ccd695a\_0\_416) thoroughly
* Read the Coach guidelines carefully and ensure you understand and agree with them. The guidelines should be followed throughout your volunteering experience

After completing the steps above, you will be assigned to a group during the JS1 module.

## Responsibilities

### What Trainees are expected to do during the coaching programme?

* Inform your group if you are not available for a meeting
* Decide what you want to discuss in the next meeting
* Reflect on what has been discussed and take actions
* Ask questions
* Update your career development plan before the meeting. This should include a maximum of 3 actions:  focus on Professional Development
* Do your [competencies review](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hwj\_KX7-gnHNVTAP98FHffpq9QUdgtPlLLuGs3Zl\_Gw/edit#gid=2086356663) before the meeting
* Always think: “Would I hire my fellow trainee?” If not, give them a clear example of why
* DO NOT use these meetings for coursework questions - that’s what your cohort slack is for

### What’s your responsibility as a PD Coach?

* Inform your group if you are not available for a meeting
* Support and encourage initiative for trainees to discuss first
* Ask open questions to support reflection, not rhetorical or yes/no questions.
* Follow up, e.g. send any documents or links you promised
* Always think: “Would I hire this trainee?” If not, give them a clear example of why
* Always guide the conversation about career and professional development. If there are any other questions, guide the trainee to discuss them with the cohort volunteers or trainees.
* Any safeguarding concerns should be raised with the staff ([cs@codeyourfuture.io](mailto:cs@codeyourfuture.io)).

# Welcome to CodeYourFuture Docs

CodeYourFuture is a non-profit volunteer-led coding community for refugees, asylum seekers and other people from under-served backgrounds. We offer a free nine-month software development programme with the aim of preparing our trainees for a job as a junior developer. We meet one day a week for the workshop, and when arranged we also meet outside of this day to help trainees with coursework and projects.

In this website you'll find all of the documentation we use to run and organise CodeYourFuture.

CodeYourFuture currently operates in the following regions:

* Glasgow
* London
* North West (based in Manchester)
* West Midlands (based in Birmingham)
* Cape Town, South Africa

# Welcome to CodeYourFuture Docs

CodeYourFuture is a non-profit volunteer-led coding community for refugees, asylum seekers and other people from under-served backgrounds. We offer a free nine-month software development programme with the aim of preparing our trainees for a job as a junior developer. We meet one day a week for the workshop, and when arranged we also meet outside of this day to help trainees with coursework and projects.&#x20;

In this website you'll find all of the documentation we use to run and organise CodeYourFuture.

CodeYourFuture currently operates in the following regions:

* Glasgow
* London
* North West (based in Manchester)
* West West (based in Birmingham)
* Cape Town, South Africa

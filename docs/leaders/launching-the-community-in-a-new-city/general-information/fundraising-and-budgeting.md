# Fundraising & budgeting

There are two possible paths to start a new chapter:

* By receiving grants or private funding;
* By starting with zero funding, which is the best way o test the grassroots potential of a new city

**What to keep in mind:**

There are some critical funding aspects such as finding laptops and covering trainees’ expenses. &#x20;

* Find Laptops
  * Ideally, you want to find second-hand laptop donations that can be given to trainees who do not have access to computers at home. This is to avoid managing laptop loans.
  * During Introduction to Digital, we suggest applicants use local libraries. But if they are halfway through Introduction to Programming they can apply to become trainees and get extra support with laptops.
  * Examples of where to find laptops:
    * Donations (businesses, charities, schools, tech companies)
    * Fundraisers to buy second-hand laptops
* At a certain point, you may need a part-time admin person who will liaise with the strategy team to support with the funding activities. Branches shouldn’t spend their time looking for funds, as there are enough other areas and tasks that they should focus on.
* If a team is well structured, start looking for corporate partners. However the suggestion is that the city does not do it on their own but works with the Strategy Team team,

# WhatsApp Community Guidelines

Welcome to our WhatsApp community for our Digital Literacy trainees. We are very excited to have you join our group!

At CodeYourFuture, we have a [Code of Conduct](https://codeyourfuture.io/about/code-of-conduct/) and our [Values and Working Principles](https://codeyourfuture.io/about/). You must follow both if you are part of our community.

Also, we have guidelines for WhatsApp, which are below. Please follow these so we can work well together.

**Communicating in the groups on WhatsApp**

* Use the main group chat when you need help or want to discuss something. That allows more people to assist and learn together.

**Please avoid the following behaviours:**

* Do not send the same message again and again across groups or to many people's inboxes. Only send helpful information.
* Share only legal content. **Do not spread illegal material.**
* Take part with sincerity. Do not try to fool or upset others.
* Do not share inappropriate or adult content. Keep our community friendly for everyone.
* Avoid offensive language and graphic content. Be respectful in all messages.
* If you see worrying behaviour or content, inform CodeYourFuture. The number to use is 07469 488132.

By being part of our WhatsApp community, you agree to follow these guidelines. This will help create a supportive place where we can all learn new skills. Violating these rules may result in removal from the groups. We want to maintain a respectful environment for all members to collaborate and grow.

Let's learn great things together!

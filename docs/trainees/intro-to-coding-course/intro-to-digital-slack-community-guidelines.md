# Intro To Digital Slack Community Guidelines

Welcome to our Slack community for our Intro to Digital trainees. We are very excited to have you join!

At Code Your Future, we have a [Code of Conduct](https://codeyourfuture.io/about/code-of-conduct/) and [Values and Working Principles](https://codeyourfuture.io/about/). You must follow the Code of Conduct and Values and Working Principles if you are part of our community.

Also, we have guidelines for Slack, which are below. Please follow these so we can work well together.

How to communicate in channels on Slack

* Use the open channels when you need help or want to discuss something. That allows more people to assist and learn together.
* There is a channel for each region, where we will share updates about the next cohort. Use these to get to know your fellow learners.
* There are also channels for each stage of the Intro to Digital course. This is where you can ask for help on your current step.
* Slack has produced a [quick start guide](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/360059928654-How-to-use-Slack--your-quick-start-guide) that might be useful to you.

Please avoid the following behaviours

* Do not send the same message again and again across channels or to many people's inboxes. Only send helpful information.
* Share only legal content. Do not spread illegal material.
* Take part with sincerity. Do not try to fool or upset others.
* Do not share inappropriate or adult content. Keep our community friendly for everyone.
* Avoid offensive language and graphic content. Be respectful in all messages.
* If you see worrying behaviour or content, inform Code Your Future immediately.
* Do not share private data on Slack. This includes phone numbers, bank details, and confidential information. Please use email.

By being part of our Slack community, you agree to follow these guidelines. This will help create a supportive place where we can all learn new skills. Violating these rules may result in removal from our Slack. We want to maintain a respectful environment for all members to collaborate and grow.

Let's learn great things together!

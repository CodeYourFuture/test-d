# CYF Products

### Who are we?

CYF Products is in charge of building software, also known as products, that can be used by us or by charities.&#x20;

### Vision

We want to use what our Community knows to build and support products that can make jobs easier at CodeYourFuture and beyond.

### Aims

* Let graduates and trainees who have finished our course work in a product team. This gives them real job experience, which helps when they look for work.
* A chance for our best students to learn how to work in a busy team
* Make our work at CYF easier and quicker so that we can help even more people with the great things our community does
* Have volunteers who can get better at their skills and support our graduates' learning journey
* Delivering value to the users: giving something useful to the people who use our products

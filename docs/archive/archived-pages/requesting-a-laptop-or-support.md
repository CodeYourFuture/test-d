# Requesting a Laptop or Support

## Requesting a Laptop

Please fill in the form below if you need a laptop to complete your coursework in our currently running courses.&#x20;

This means you do not have access to Â£300 to purchase a laptop yourself. If CodeYourFuture gives you a laptop, you agree to take care of it and return it within 14 days of the end of your course.&#x20;

If you break or lose any part of the laptop, you must contact us at contact@codeyourfuture.io so we can arrange a replacement if we have stock available.

## Requesting Other Hardware

We can also support you with reimbursement for other hardware for accessibility needs.

* Webcams
* Headphones and Microphones
* Keyboard
* Mouse

Please email expenses@codeyourfuture.io to discuss any of your accessibility needs before purchasing.

## Requesting Internet

If your internet is slow and you cannot access online calls or learning content, we can pay for 4G/5G internet for you.

We normally supply you with 30GB or Unlimited amounts of data.&#x20;

We can also pay for you to upgrade your phone data contract.

## Requesting Childcare Support

We can offer childcare reimbursement for your children during class and study groups.

Please read the [trainee expenses policy ](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/trainees/support/trainee-expenses)for more info on childcare.

## Requesting Travel Costs

If you are required to travel to class and cannot afford it, we can pay for your travel expenses.&#x20;

Normally, we ask you to pay your provider and then reimburse you for the costs. Otherwise, we can provide you with a travel card for the city where CodeYourFuture operates.

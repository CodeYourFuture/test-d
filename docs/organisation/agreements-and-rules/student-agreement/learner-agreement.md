# Learner Agreement

Everyone in our community must read and sign the Code of Conduct

[Read our Code of Conduct](https://codeyourfuture.io/about/code-of-conduct/)

I confirm that I will

* Follow the Code of Conduct ✅

As a Learner, if you don't come to class, do the work, or learn programming, you aren't actually doing the course. This isn't a _rule_ it's just a _fact_. This agreement is to help you understand how to succeed on this course. Our goal is to help you succeed.&#x20;

We advise our learners to also fulfil the commitments below. Please read and sign this agreement.

#### As a learner I agree to:

* Do my work  ✅
* Come to class ✅
* Take part on Slack ✅
* Ask for help ✅

If you don't do these things, you will fail Intro to Programming, because doing these things is what learning means.

We will not exclude you from our community. You are welcome to withdraw as a learner and join us as a volunteer. You are welcome to reapply next time. You are welcome here.

### Details

#### 1. Do your work ✅

Our curriculum is free and open source. Everybody in the world can use it at their own pace and do whatever coursework they like, without obligation. But if you're coming to class as a Learner, then do it properly.

1. **Coursework**

If you fall behind with your coursework it is your responsibility to catch up.

I confirm that I will:

* Submit my mandatory coursework on time  ✅
* Not blindly copy-paste from AI, GitHub, or anywhere else because the point of this course is to learn to code ✅

If you don't do your work you will fail Intro to Programming.

2. **Collaboration**

Working together is expected at Code Your Future. Software is built by teams.

I confirm that I will

* Credit the people I worked with on any document ✅
* Add my co-authors on any pull request ✅

Coursework submitted without this, but with answers shared between learners, will be treated as deception.

If you lie about your work you will be asked to leave Code Your Future.

#### 2. Come to class ✅

If you prefer to only learn online you should[ take an online course instead](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gO2iX0aoKyb3yCKmjhTr2FyKgDhnlzXbe0pdYOBzU\_E/edit?usp=sharing). Our programme is in person.

I confirm that I will:

* Attend class on Saturdays ✅
* Notify the class channel if I am unavoidably absent ✅

#### 3. Take part on Slack ✅

Slack is how we communicate.&#x20;

I confirm that I will

* Install Slack on my main computer ✅
* Answer @mentions within 72 hours ✅
* Ask or answer at least one question a week in my class channel ✅

If you don't take part on Slack you will fail Intro to Programming.

#### 4. Ask for Help ✅

It is your responsibility and right to ask for help as a member of the Code Your Future community.

I confirm that I will

* Ask for help when I need it ✅

Your community is filled with smart people who have experience and support they can share with you. Work together. The wider CYF community can help too. It’s full of graduates who have already been on your journey, and other professionals who want to help you succeed.

If you are facing a serious challenge (homelessness, cancer, detainment etc) that affects your learning, email [cs@codeyourfuture.io](mailto:cs@codeyourfuture.io) and[ get signposted to specialist help](https://signposts.codeyourfuture.io/).

When you need help, you must ask. We will help you. Our goal is your success.

#### Withdrawing From The Course

Leaving the course does not mean leaving our community. You may return as a volunteer and/or you may apply for a future cohort. If you are participating as a learner, you have no obligation to formally withdraw. But please tell us anyway! We will worry about you if you don't.

Many CYF grads have withdrawn, returned and got good jobs in tech. We will welcome you back when you are ready.&#x20;

You are welcome here even if things have gone really wrong before.

1. &#x20;**Removal From Course**

Participation in the course is overseen completely by CodeYourFuture staff. All decisions are final and cannot be contested.

If you have withdrawn or been removed from our course, you are welcome to re-apply, unless you have been permanently banned for a Code of Conduct violation.

Everyone here wants to help you get a good job in tech, for real. That is the whole point of Code Your Future.

Please now sign this agreement.

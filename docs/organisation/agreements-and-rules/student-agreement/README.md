### Details

#### 1. Do your work ✅

Our curriculum is free and open source. Everybody in the world can use it at their own pace and do whatever coursework they like, without obligation. But being a Code Your Future trainee is a privilege and a responsibility.

1. **Coursework**

If you fall behind with your coursework it is your responsibility to catch up.

I confirm that I will:

* Submit my mandatory coursework on time  ✅
* Not blindly copy-paste from AI, GitHub, or anywhere else because the point of this course is to learn to code ✅

If you don't do your work you will be dismissed as a trainee.

2. [Performance Improvement Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-xnyqKUJrqrlt\_kBYC4d3aTq4cXxfqxA7cXuelkfe0c/edit?usp=sharing) (PIP)

If you have failed to meet your commitments, you may be invited to complete and sign a PIP. A PIP is a way to get extra support and resources to help you succeed.

3. **Collaboration**

Working together is expected at Code Your Future. Software is built by teams.

I confirm that I will

* Credit the people I worked with on any document ✅
* Add my co-authors on any pull request ✅

Coursework submitted without this, but with answers shared between trainees, will be treated as deception.

If you lie about your work you will be dismissed as a trainee.

#### 2. Come to class ✅

If you prefer to only learn online you should[ take an online course instead](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10eslKs671f5NjVFb67-YS-BfARioHc8m8w0\_tS\_DG-o/edit?usp=sharing). Our programme is in person.

I confirm that I will:

* Attend at least 90% of classes in the Software Development Course and 100% of classes in The Piscine ✅
* Notify the class channel if I am unavoidably absent ✅

If you don't come to class you will be dismissed as a trainee.

1. &#x20;**Leave**

You may need to take unavoidable medical leave. You may be moved by the Home Office. A war may start in your country. These are all normal at Code Your Future and we understand. You must tell us as soon as you can.

If I need to take unavoidable leave I confirm that I will

* Email my region as soon as possible  ✅
* Complete a [leave form](https://forms.gle/FbiQzDkRQ6p1RTee7) ✅

#### 3. Take part on Slack ✅

Slack is how we communicate. We monitor Slack activity.

I confirm that I will

* Install Slack on my main computer ✅
* Answer @mentions within 72 hours ✅
* Ask or answer at least one question a week in my class channel ✅

If you don't take part on Slack you will be dismissed as a trainee.

#### 4. Ask for Help ✅

It is your responsibility and right to ask for help as a Code Your Future trainee.

I confirm that I will

* Ask for help when I need it ✅

Your cohort is filled with smart people who have experience and support they can share with you. Work together. The wider CYF community can help too. It’s full of graduates who have already been on your journey, and other professionals who want to help you succeed.

If you are facing a serious challenge (homelessness, cancer, detainment etc) that affects your learning, email [cs@codeyourfuture.io](mailto:cs@codeyourfuture.io) and[ get signposted to specialist help](https://signposts.codeyourfuture.io/).

When you need help, you must ask. We will help you. **Our goal is your success.**

#### Withdrawing From The Course

You must contact us to withdraw from the course.

Leaving the course does not mean leaving our community. You may return as a volunteer and/or you may apply for a future cohort.

I confirm that I will

* Complete a[ Withdrawal Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScfOb2GXy34IGumx6LbEodFyeJXNGB9IR-tSG0ESM4uBjXGAw/viewform) ✅
* Return any equipment I borrowed ✅

(If you don't do this part, you can't come back.)

Many CYF grads have withdrawn, returned and got good jobs in tech. We will welcome you back when you are ready. We will welcome you even if you were dismissed.

**You are welcome here** even if things have gone really wrong before.

1. &#x20;**Removal From Course**

Participation in the course is overseen completely by CodeYourFuture staff. All decisions are final and cannot be contested.

If you have withdrawn or been removed from our course, you are welcome to re-apply, unless you have been permanently banned for a Code of Conduct violation.

Everyone here wants to help you get a good job in tech, for real. That is the whole point of Code Your Future.
